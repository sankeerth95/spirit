An openGL based game engine, designed for ease of use. 
The complexity in building a game engine is as complex as building a car engine: many
components working together, each performing it's own duty.
This project is merely a reinventinon each individual components as to demonstrate
the organization of an industry grade in a software product.

Note: the concept and design of this project is not intended
to support sophistication, but instead workability.
